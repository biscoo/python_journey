# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey — 100 Days of Code Bootcamp

Hi, I'm **Beshoy** 👋  
I’m learning Python through the **100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp**, focusing on building strong fundamentals, improving problem-solving skills, and writing cleaner, more organized code.

This repository documents my daily progress, exercises, and projects as I move step by step toward becoming a confident Python developer.

---

## 🚧 Current Progress

✅ **Completed up to Day 26**  
📅 Actively continuing the 100 Days of Code challenge

By Day 26, I’ve gained hands-on experience with Python basics, object-oriented programming, file handling, and data manipulation. Each day helped improve not just my coding skills, but also my **way of thinking and approaching problems logically**.

---

## 🧩 Key Topics Covered (Days 1–26)

- Python fundamentals (variables, data types, conditions, loops)
- Functions and scope
- Lists, dictionaries, and string manipulation
- File handling (read/write text files)
- Error handling basics
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, methods, attributes)
- Working with external data (CSV files)
- Python list & dictionary comprehensions
- Debugging and code refactoring
- Writing cleaner, more maintainable code

---

## 🛠 Notable Projects & Exercises

- Calculator & logic-based programs
- File-based projects (Mail Merge, High Score system)
- NATO Phonetic Alphabet Converter
- Quiz Game using OOP
- Snake Game (game logic, collisions, scoring)
- Multiple small exercises focused on logic and clean coding

Each project is organized by day and stored in its own folder with readable and commented code.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- Built-in modules (`random`, `time`, `math`, `os`)
- `pandas` (CSV handling)
- Git & GitHub
- PyCharm

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Build a strong foundation in Python
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking
- Write clean, readable, and structured code
- Complete all 100 days of the bootcamp
- Prepare for junior software or Python developer opportunities

---

## 🔭 What’s Next

- Continue with intermediate Python topics
- Build more automation and data-focused projects
- Improve error handling and code testing
- Strengthen GitHub portfolio with documentation and refactoring
