# 🚀 My Python Learning Journey — 100 Days of Code Bootcamp

Hi, I'm **Beshoy** 👋  
I'm transitioning from a **SATCOM engineering** background into **software development** — combining my technical systems expertise with a growing passion for Python.

This repository documents my journey through the **100 Days of Code Bootcamp**, where I’m learning Python fundamentals, automation, and software design — one day at a time.

I’m currently on **Day 15 / 100**, steadily building skills through daily exercises and small projects.

## 🧠 Goals
- Build a strong foundation in Python programming  
- Learn to design clean, maintainable, and efficient code  
- Apply problem-solving skills from telecom & systems integration to software challenges  
- Transition into a development-focused role within technology or systems automation

## 🗂️ Structure
| Phase | Days | Focus |
|--------|------|--------|
| 🧩 Foundation | 01–20 | Python basics, data types, control flow, and functions |
| ⚙️ Core Concepts | 21–50 | Object-Oriented Programming, error handling, and file operations |
| 🌐 Applications | 51–75 | Web development, APIs, and automation |
| 📊 Advanced Projects | 76–100 | Final portfolio projects, data handling, and deployment |

## 🌟 Mini Projects (Days 1 – 15)
Here are the small but meaningful projects I’ve completed so far as part of my learning process:

| Project | Description | Skills / Topics |
|----------|--------------|----------------|
| 🖨️ Hello World | First Python script and setup | print(), syntax, strings |
| 🧮 Simple Calculator | Performs arithmetic based on user input | input(), operators, conditionals |
| 📅 Age Calculator | Calculates user’s age from birth year | input(), f-strings, type conversion |
| 🎲 Dice Roller | Simulates dice rolls using random numbers | random, loops |
| 📊 Tip Calculator | Splits a restaurant bill with tip | arithmetic, user input |
| 🔁 Number Guessing Game | Guess a random number with hints | random, conditionals, loops |
| ✏️ Password Generator | Creates random passwords of chosen length | random, strings |
| 🪙 Heads or Tails | Coin flip simulation | random, logic |
| 🧾 Band Name Generator | Generates fun band names | input(), string concatenation |
| 🔢 Odd or Even Checker | Checks if a number is odd or even | modulo operator, conditionals |
| 🧍 BMI Calculator | Calculates Body Mass Index | math, input/output |
| 📂 File Reader | Opens and reads a text file | file handling, open() |
| 📑 Word Counter | Counts words in a file | string methods, loops |
| 📅 Birthday Reminder | Reads and lists birthdays from a file | file handling, datetime |
| 🔢 Prime Number Checker | Determines if a number is prime | loops, conditionals |

> ⚙️ Each project is in its own folder (Day01 – Day15) with clean, commented code.

## 📈 Next Steps
- Learn lists, tuples, and dictionaries  
- Build my first **text-based game**  
- Explore basic **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
- Learn to use external libraries and APIs  
- Begin building my first small web app (Flask or Streamlit)

---

## 🎯 Long-Term Vision
- Complete the **100 Days of Code** challenge  
- Contribute to open-source projects  
- Build end-to-end applications that combine **network automation** and **data-driven logic**  
- Transition fully into a **Python developer** or **automation engineer** role
