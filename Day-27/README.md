# 📏 Distance Converter (Tkinter)

A simple **Python desktop application** built with **Tkinter** that converts distances between **Kilometers and Miles** in both directions.

This project helped me practice **GUI development**, **event-driven programming**, and **clean code structure** while improving how I think about user interaction and application logic.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Two-way conversion:
  - Kilometers → Miles
  - Miles → Kilometers
- 🔘 Toggle button to switch conversion direction
- 🧮 Accurate conversion with rounding to 4 decimal places
- ♻ Reset button to clear inputs and results
- 🎨 Clean and simple UI with padding and styled buttons

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (built-in Python GUI library)

---

## 📸 Application Layout

- Top button: Choose conversion direction
- Input field: Enter distance value
- Convert button: Perform conversion
- Reset button: Clear input and output
- Output label: Displays result

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to build GUI applications using Tkinter
- Managing application state (conversion direction)
- Updating UI elements dynamically
- Writing reusable and readable functions
- Improving user experience with layout and design choices

This project helped me move from simple scripts to **interactive applications**, changing the way I approach problem-solving in Python.
